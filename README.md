# Endpoint Frontend Coding Challenge

## Getting Started

First make sure you have installed the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now ensure you have a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

or 

```bash
npm run t
```


## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, deploy the contents of the `out` directory to your server.
